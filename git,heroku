-Install git on ur local machine.

Which basically a tool which takes care of every thing that goes on ur local machine. Like creating repo on local machine, handling all ur commands, blah blah.

-Create a folder on ur local machine.

- cd in folder

- git init (It creates .git folder in this folder which basically tells git that this is kind of like local repo)

this is git folder now(we can say it is a local repo on ur machine)

-every time u create new file in this file u need to first add this file 

e.g. git add <file_name>

-then you need to commit this file to ur local repo

git commit <file_name>

this is like commit which we used to do in siemens. Here the repo is on ur local machine to which ur committing  new file.

- At any given point of time u can hit 

git status commands

this will tell u which all files are just 'added' and not committed.

- After this we need to tell git that there is a remote repo “GitHub” where we want to push out code.

-for this 

git remote add origin https://github.com/mayurisapre/myproject.git

git remote -v

-now u can push/pull code from ur local repo(ur machine to this remote repo)



TO DEPLOY APP FROM UR LOCAL GIT TO HEROKU--

- do “heroku login”
		
		give username and password
- heroku create
 		this will just create platform for ur app and url for ur app
